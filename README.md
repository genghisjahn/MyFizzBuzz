MyFizzBuzz
==========

My go at the standard Fizz Buzz problem.  Written in C#

This is my stab at the FizzBuzz programming problem as described here:

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

My first version was written in 18 minutes.
